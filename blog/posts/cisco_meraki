Cisco Meraki is the enterprise router solution for businesses big and small. 
I got my hands on a router via a close friend 
who found and old one in his basement.

Cisco Meraki requires a yearly subscription to work. Since my friend was no longer interested in paying it, I decided to take a 
crack at getting it to work without a subscription.

The cisco meraki hosts a lighttpd webserver on port 80. This webserver trigger the captive portal which tries to get you to sign in.
However you can navigate to the router IP and get the a portal.

The first instinct was opening it up in burpsuite and looking at the request and responses.
