Also note that this technology might not be legal in your jurisdiction. Please engage in due diligence before deploying your own instance.\nIntroduction Tornado Cash was back the news recently due to lifting of US sanctions. The website was under sanctions due to (alleged) money laundering charges. The US government argued that the website facilitated money laundering by hacking outfits such as Lazarus and processed amounts exceeding ~$1billion USD. However, this year, the courts ruled that the fundamental technology behind Torando Cash, the EVM Smart Contracts which contain the ZK based logic do not constitute property and thus its creators can be held liable for the its misuse (Ask your friendly US lawyer for details)\nThis blog will explain how the ZK based logic works.\nIndex What is a Smart Contract What are ZK Proofs Solidity and Circom Tornado Cash Design What is a Smart Contract A Smart contract is bytecode on a blockchain which executed under certain conditions. It can recieve inputs; it can produce output; it can preserve state and interact with other contracts in the blockchain.\nA smart contract exists at a fixed address on the blockchain. Not all blockchains support smart contracts; Ethereum does while Bitcoin doesn’t. On Ethereum blockchain, a smart contract is also called a EVM or Etherum Virtual Machine. These terms can abd will be used interchangebly in the blogpost.\nTo interact with a EVM, you send a transaction to it’s address on the blockchain. The trasanction can contain inputs on which the EVM will act on and it can also signal output for the user who sent that transaction. The format of the transaction can vary and is dependent on the EVM.\nA smart contract/EVM basically functions as virtual computer; it has compute and it can have storage. The compute and the storage are not predefined. Instead, a user for a smart contract pays for both compute and storage when sending a transaction using gas fees (basically transaction fees paid in Eth) Each user pays for the marginal change in the storage (read/write costs) as well as the compute cost required by the EVM to process just that specific transaction. These costs can vary between transactions and are dependent on the design on the smart contract. More compute and more storage require more gas fees. Ideally, the smart contract designer will have designed the contarct to use the minimum possible amount of gas possible. Note: this implmentation is not optimized so deploying this will result in higher gas fees than tornado cash\nWhat are ZK proof? This chatgpt’s summary:\n** Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK Proofs) are cryptographic techniques that allow one party (called the prover) to prove to another party (called the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the truth of the statement itself.\n🔍 Simple Analogy Imagine you want to prove you know the password to a door, but you don’t want to reveal the actual password. A ZK proof is like being able to demonstrate that you can open the door (showing you know the password), without ever telling the verifier what the password is. **\nTornado Cash uses ZK proof to allow a withdrawer to prove that they hold a receipt for an existing deposit without disclosing which deposit matches this withdrawal. When a deposit is made, the depositor recieves a secret note which is the sole item required for a successful withdrawal. The withdrawer must have the same secret to withdraw that deposit.\nNow, you may ask, how does Tornado cash know which deposit mathces that\n","wordCount":"790","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://jchauhn.github.io:443/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2025-06-09T11:30:03Z","dateModified":"2025-06-09T11:30:03Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jchauhn.github.io:443/posts/tornadocash/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"jc's blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jchauhn.github.io:443/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/extended/chroma.css><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><br></nav></header><div class=layout-with-left-panel><div class=left-panel><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><div id=left-panel><h1>jc's blog</h1><p class=infoblob>Collection of personal ideas & arcane reseach</p><a class=corelink href=/posts>Posts</a>
