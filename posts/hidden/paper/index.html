Apple’s Permission Arch 3. Threat Model 4. Developer Journey Build During the build process of the application the developer has to go over several hoops.\nApple Docs Apple has a large developer documentation dataset: Too Big to Digest\nApple guidelines are spread accross documentation, press releases and developer notes: Spread out\nConfusing and often contradictory defintions of key terms such as user tracking and PIIs: Divergence from default understanding\nCode Knowledge Code knowledge refers to a developer’s understanding of the code included in the application. This includes both\n1st Party Code: written by the developer themselves 3rd Party Code: used but not written by the dev FACT: Developers often have incomplete knowledge about their products.\n1st party Code: Developers often borrow code from other source: Stackoverflow, Blogs and AI coding agents. They are often goal oriented and thus gloss over details of the what APIs are being called. e.g. a photo editing app dev requests access to whole media library insted of user-selected photos\n3rd Party Code: Can be included via\nlibaries .framework modules .app bundles standable binaries Uses:\nCore functionality: Necessary for app function e.g. implementing SSL ( gprc) or Realtime DB (via fiebase) Customer Insight: Tracking application metrics to improve the applications Advertsing: Tracking users across apps and which can then called by the Application for a particular purpose. Most of the most popular frameworks are created by Ad Tech giants like Meta and Google, the developer has little transparency and consequently understanding of the undelying logic.\nINSIGHT: Thus is very tough for developer to understand code behavior of complex libraries included in the code code.\nTo ease this, Apple forces developers of 3rd Party Kits to publish Privacy manifests which require disclosure of a subset of API calls. These are supposed to be a guide for the developers wishing to include their kit. There are two primary problems:\nFew devs know about privacy manifests Manifests offer incomplete coverage of APIs ( Unique Finding ) Some of the 3P code devs like Meta and Google also have their own documentation regarding their frameworks.Primary Problem: Definition of key terms vary between developers and jurisdictions and thus can lead to unintended misrepresentations\nSubmission Then the developer submits their application to the App Store Connect for inclusion in the App Store, they need to provide\nPrivacy Manifest: Developer need to disclose if their code uses fingerprintable APIs. Specific APIs are listed here. Developers are also required to list why they are using a particular API call. This data is not verified.\nNOTE: Developer need to disclose API use across both 1st Party + 3rd Party code*\nNutrition Labels: Developer need to fill out a data-collected checklist for their application. All the requisite data points are listed here This data is mandatory and is posted on the download page. This data is not verified.\n1. Experiment Design GOAL: Uncover App’s Data collection Behavior programtically. Key Knowledge: Most of the sensitive PIIs in MacOS for the user are exposed to application via operating system APIs.\nThe crux of the experiment revolves around intercepting sensitive APIs to understand which component of the application actually requested the data in question.\n1.1 Finding APIs ( static analysis ) building a list of sentive MacOS APIs. This is no small feat given the breadth and the depth of the Darwin arch. We build this repository of MacOS APIs by manully crawling Apple’s Documentation and their public archives. manually test these APIs to confirm the sensitive nature of the returned information. On this note, we have built a executable which are the queries these APIs to build a system fingerprinting report.\n1.2 Hooking APIs (dynamic analysis) Intercepting these APIs involves runtime modification of the binary via Frida.\nFrida is open source reverse engineering framework primarily designed for iPhone and Android. Frida allows us to “hook” function calls i.e. it allows us to control the behavior of the instruction pointer both before and after a function from the binary symbol table is called. Frida allows for this manipulation via its functions “onEnter” and “onLeave”.\nBy adding conditionals and logging statements to these onEnter and onLeave for a variey of known senstive MacOS APIs, we gain insight into the Apps behvaior intended or otherwise.\nWe intercept MacOS APIs via Frida’s python bindings. We modify the onEnter for the collected APIs and then log the Backtrace and the frequency of API calls.\nBacktrace: The Backtrace is the call track trace of the system when the call was made i.e it catures all the parent functions which led to the particular call.\nThis backtrace is is fuzzy, i,e it attributes to the underlying binary/dynamic library which led to the call. This allows us to understand whether first party code or included libraries led to the sensitive API call.\n1.3 Network Interception Another component of the dynamic analysis is the MiTM netork intercetion via mitmproxy. We capture all the HTTP(S) and DNS requests. We attempt to extract any identifiers being sent and we also track the connection made to known ad domains.\n1.4 Simulated Interaction One of our unique contributions to this research is AI driven interaction which utilizes the MacOS’s Accessiblity Framework to interact witht he application intelligently. We capture the app window data via the Accessiblity Framework and forward it OpenAI’s API. The ML models interacts with the application using a fixed framework of object clicks and keyboard inputs interpreted via the MCP model. The modifed an new repository macos-Use to allow for almost completly autonomous interaction. The only challanege are signup screen and email verification which were non-trivial to bypass. Hence, the autonomous interaction begins once the app is signed it or shows a dashboard.\n2. Prior Work \u003c EMPTY \u003e\n4. Results Apps failed to disclose use accross ALL DATA Categories Nutrition Labels\n5. Findings 5.1 Privacy Manifest API coverage incomplete NSWorkspace: Provides information regarding the current workspace. Provides information regarding Computer Name: Can include the name of user e.g. Jyotirmay’s MacBook Pro Running Application: List of all running applications on the user system including executable location. Provides insight into user’s behavior and system volumes NSProcessInfo: Provides insight into the process’s own enviroment and launch conditions and variables Hostname: Can leak the network name of the machine e.g. j-macbook-pro.local OS version: Discloses the current version 15.5.0 System uptime: Can disclose time since kernel reboot. This is Apple’s acknowledged fingerprint indicator and it value is controlled via required use APIs Full username: Can be used to read the users full name as saved by the device. Processor Count \u0026 Memory Size: Additional fingerprinting information about the system 5.2 New tracking vector: NSUserDefaults NSUserDefaults provides information regarding the users default settings. Also used by apps as a Key Value Store.\nLeaks:\nTime Zone City: Not just the time zone but the closest city set by Apple’s during setup. Peripherals Identifier: Leaks data about the dispplays connected 5.3 Apps in Mac Store with incorrect information Actively Disingeneoud\nMisconfigured\nContributions 1.
